            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Corvallis, Oregon, where I grew up riding my bike. Over the years, I've lived in various places across the country, including the DC Metro area, New York City, Denver, Tucson, and Los Angeles. Each place has shaped my perspective and interests in different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days, my focus is on my daughter and my work, both clinical and research-related. I'm an Attending Physician in Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where I investigate the intersections of nutrition, infection, and liver disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working or spending time with my daughter, you'll find me in the garage lifting weights—my primary way to stay active and manage the demands of work and family life.

            <h2>Denver Sunsets</h2>
            <p>
                During my years in Denver, I developed a love for capturing the incredible sunsets over the Rocky Mountains. Here are a few of my favorites from that time.
