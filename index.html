            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Corvallis, Oregon, where I grew up riding my bike—a passion that has stayed with me throughout my life. Over the years, I've lived in various places across the country, including the DC Metro area, New York City, Denver, Tucson, and Los Angeles. Each place has shaped my perspective and interests in different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days, my focus is on my daughter and my work, both clinical and research-related. I'm an Attending Physician in Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where I investigate the intersections of nutrition, infection, and liver disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working, you'll likely find me on my bike, exploring the roads and trails around Los Angeles.
